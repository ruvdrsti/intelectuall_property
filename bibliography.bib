abstract = {This study investigated the effects of the use of augmented reality (AR) technologies in science laboratories on university students' laboratory skills and attitudes towards laboratories. A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test control group design was employed. The participants were 76 first-year university students, aged 18–20 years old. They were assigned to either an experimental or a control group. Qualitative and quantitative data collection tools were used. The experimental results obtained following the 5-week application revealed that the AR technology significantly enhanced the development of the university students' laboratory skills. AR technology both improved the students’ laboratory skills and helped them to build positive attitudes towards physics laboratories. The statements of the students and the instructor regarding other effects of AR technology on science laboratories, both negative and positive, are also discussed.}
